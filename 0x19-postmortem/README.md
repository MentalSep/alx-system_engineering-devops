# Postmortem: Web Stack Outage on February 18, 2024

## Issue Summary

**Duration:**  
Start Time: February 18, 2024, 10:15 AM (GMT)  
End Time: February 18, 2024, 1:45 PM (GMT)

**Impact:**  
The outage affected the core authentication service, leading to a complete denial of service for users attempting to log in. Approximately 30% of users experienced disruptions, resulting in login failures and delayed access to critical features.

**Root Cause:**  
The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, leading to an excessive number of connection attempts to the authentication service.

## Timeline

- *10:15 AM:*  
  Issue detected by monitoring alerts indicating a surge in failed authentication attempts.

- *10:20 AM:*  
  Engineering team notified of the issue through automated alerts.

- *10:30 AM:*  
  Investigation initiated to identify the cause. Initial assumption was a potential DDoS attack due to the sudden spike in failed login attempts.

- *11:00 AM:*  
  DDoS mitigation measures implemented, including rate limiting and IP blocking, without resolution. Misleading assumption led to a delay in identifying the true root cause.

- *12:00 PM:*  
  Incident escalated to the networking team as further investigation revealed load balancer misconfiguration.

- *1:00 PM:*  
  Load balancer settings corrected, and service gradually restored. Incident resolved.

## Root Cause and Resolution

**Root Cause:**  
The root cause was a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, causing it to distribute an overwhelming number of requests to the authentication service, resulting in service degradation.

**Resolution:**  
The misconfigured load balancer settings were corrected by adjusting connection limits and load distribution algorithms. This immediate fix allowed normal traffic flow to the authentication service, resolving the outage.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Improvements/Fixes:**  

1. **Automated Load Balancer Configuration Checks:** Implement automated checks to ensure load balancer configurations align with best practices and predefined thresholds.

2. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Strengthen monitoring for authentication service performance metrics, including connection rates and error rates, to detect anomalies more rapidly.

**Tasks to Address the Issue:**  

1. **Load Balancer Configuration Review:** Conduct a thorough review of load balancer configurations to identify and rectify any potential misconfigurations.

2. **Incident Response Training:** Provide additional training for the incident response team to improve the speed and accuracy of initial assessments during outages.
3. **Documentation Update:** Document the lessons learned and corrective actions in the incident response playbook for future reference.
4. **User Communication Protocol:** Establish a clear communication protocol to promptly inform users about service outages, expected resolution times, and ongoing updates.

By implementing these measures, we aim to enhance the resilience of our web stack and minimize the impact of potential issues on our users.
